# html5-canvas-snake-game

A simple snake game built using HTML5 canvas, JavaScript and a bit of CSS.

## Fork, improve, and let's meet

If you want to work on the game by improving its UI and make your own version out of it. Let's meet then in a future meetup and I'll give you some swag if you've really made something cool :)
I can't wait to see what you build with this.

Things you could do:

- Add stages. I.e. Stage1, Stage2 progressing forward
- Maybe more than one apple?
- Different game speeds
- More than one lives before the score is reset
- Intro screen
